# Introduction
Disclaimer:

- The goal of this repository is to get more familiar with the concepts of **`Hidden Markov Models`** (**= HMM**).
- The scope of ambition is therefore limited and the examples are very simple, only serving educational purposes.

Addressed topics:
- Problem setting using a basic example to introduce the **HMM terminology**.
- Illustration of the **Bayes Rule** to determine the most likely sequence of state given a observation sequence.
- Implementation of the **Forward and Backward Algorithm** to compute the probability of a particular observation sequence.
- Implementation of the **Viterbi Algorithm** to find the most likely sequence of hidden states which could have generated a given observation sequence (**posterior decoding**).
- Implementation of the **Baum-Welch Algorithm** to find the most likely parameters (state transition and emmission models) of the HMM given a observation sequence (**parameter learning** task).

# Problem motivation
For left-hand-drive countries such as the UK, just invert the reasoning :smiley:

- Your car is driving on a **2-lane highway**.
- Imagine that you can **remotely monitor the velocity of the car (I communicate it to you)**
- But you do have **no direct access to the lateral position** (`right lane` of `left lane`). Formally, you **cannot view the underlying stochastic walk between `lane` states**.
- How could you deduce the `lane` based on the single information we receive (the `speed`)?

### Emission probability

If I am telling you that I am driving with a `low speed`, you **may deduce** that I am on the right lane.
- For instance, because I am just driving alone at a reasonable pace
- Or because I am blocked by a slow vehicle.
- But I could also drive fast on this `right lane` *(have you ever been driving alone on a German highway?)*

Similarly, if you get informed of a `high speed`, you could say that I am **more likely** to be driving on the left lane.
- Probably overtaking another vehicle.
- Nevertheless, this is **not always true**: think of the situation where you are waiting on the left lane behind a truck trying to overtake another truck.

We get a **first intuition**:
- The variable `lane` seems to have an impact on the variable `speed`.
- In  other words: **you do not drive at the same pace depending if you are one the `left lane` or the `right lane`**.
- But the relation is **not deterministic**, rather **stochastic**.

This finding will be modelled using **`emission probabilities`** in the following.

### Transition probability

You could have another intuition:
- Human drivers usually **stay on their lanes**.
- Hence if you are on `right lane` at time `t`, you are likely to still be on `right lane` at time `t+1`.
- Again, this **does not always hold** and you can find **exception**.
- But here comes a second intuition: **the `lane` at time `t` is influenced by the `lane` at time `t-1`**.

The concept of **`transition probability`** will be used to model this second remark.

## Terminology

## Objectives

We can now define three problems which can be solved by an HMM:

- 1- **Learning**
	- The first is **learning the parameters** of its **the latent structure** (emission, transition and initial state models).
	- In the case of a known structure and some fully observable sampling, on can apply the concept of **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** (MLE):
		- Some observation sequences (`speed`) and their associated states (`lane`) have been collected. The **samples** form the **training dataset**.
		- The parameter can be selected so as to maximise the likelihood for the model to have produced the data from the given dataset.
	- In case it is not possible to sample from hidden states (partially observable), one can use **Expectation Maximization** (EM) or **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** (MCMC)
	- Learning is covered in questions [Q1](#q1) and [Q5](#q5)

- 2- **Evaluation**
	- The second task is to find, given a HMM, how likely is it to get a observation sequence.
	- It is covered in question [Q3](#q3)

- 3- **Inference**
	- The third one is applying the trained HMM to an observation sequence. We want to find the sequence of states **that best explains** the observation sequence.
	- Concretly we want to **infer the sequence of lanes** driven by the car ((`right` or `left`) = **hidden state**) based on a **sequence of speed measurements** (= **observation**).
	- In this case, you can thing of HMM as a **sequence classifier** (if we make the hidden state of HMM fixed, it would have been a **Naive Bayes classifier**).
	- Inference is covered in questions [Q2](#q2) and [Q4](#q4)
	- Three types of inference can be distinguished:
		- **Filtering**: determine the latest belief state, i.e. the posterior distribution P(`lane(t)` given [`speed(1)`, ..., `speed(t)`])
		- **Decoding**: determine the hidden state sequence, that gives the best explanation for the observation sequence
			- find [`lane(1)`, ..., `lane(t)`] that maximizes P([`lane(1)`, ..., `lane(t)`] given [`speed(1)`, ..., `speed(t)`])
			- it is **equivalent to maximizing the Joint Probability** P([`lane(1)`, ..., `lane(t)`] given [`speed(1)`, ..., `speed(t)`]) since the marginal over observation is independant of the variables we are maximizing over.
		- **Prediction**: determine the probability for the future hidden state in K steps, i.e. the posterior conditional distribution P(`lane(t+K)` given [`speed(1)`, ..., `speed(t)`] )
		- **Smooting**: determine the probability for the past hidden state K steps ago, i.e. the posterior conditional distribution P(`lane(t-K)` given [`speed(1)`, ..., `speed(t)`] )
		
## Assumptions
To keep the problem as simple as possible:
- Let's **discretize the speed** into `low speed` and `high speed`.
- Time steps are discretized.
- Lane transitions are ignored: either you are on `left lane` or you are on `right lane`.

### Stationary Process

- We assume that the HMM models (transition and emission matrices and initial distribution) are **constant over time**
- `P[speed(t)` given `lane(t)]`, `P[lane(t+1)` given `lane(t)]` and `P[lane(t)]` are independant of `t`.

### Observation Independence

- We talked about emission probability, explaining that state `lane (t)` impacts observation `speed (t)`.
- One could other sources of influence: `speed (t-1)` and `lane (t-1)` for instance. 
- Here we assume that the **probability of an observation depends only on the state that produced the observation** and not on any other states or any other observations
- Each observation variable `speed` depends only on the current state `lane`.
- This is a **strong assumption** since we decide not to capture dependencies between each input element in the observation sequence
- But it will **relax computation** during decoding.
- In supervised learning terminology: **"each feature (observation) is conditional independent of every other feature, given the class (hidden state)"**
- As for Naive Bayes, probabilities are independent given the class `y` and hence can be **"naively"** multiplied: p(`x1,x2,â€¦,x1|y`)`=`p(`x1|y`) `*` p(`x2|y`) `*` ... `*` p(`xm|y`)

### First-order Markov Property

- We just said that it is useful to know the present `lane` (at time `t`) to infer the future `lane` (at time `t+1`).
- What about the previous `lane` at `t-1`? It probably also hold relevant information?
- Here is a strong assumption about inferring in this stochastic process:
	- the conditional probability distribution of **future states** of the process (conditional on both past and present states) **depends only upon the present state**, not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
- In other words, **"the future is independant of the past given the present"**.
- This **strong assumption** is known as the first-order **Markov Property** (also named **"memoryless property"**) and will make computations easier in the following.

Based on these assumptions, the problem can be modelled using a **graphical model**:
- The **Markov Property** makes sure state connection occurs only for consecutive states.
- The **Output Independence** is responsible for each observation to receive only a single edge (coming from the associated state).
- HMM are **directed models** (hence arrows) since we can distinguish what is the reason (`lane` state) and what is the result (`speed` observation).
- HMM is a special case of **Dynamic Bayesian Network** (Dynamic belief network) since it forms a **probabilistic directed acyclic graphical model**.

## Relations with other machine learning techniques

For better understanding, I find convenient to compare HMMs with the other algorithms and methods I know.

- HMM is a special case of **Finite State Machine** (FSM).
- **Kalman Filters** can be conceived of as continuous valued HMMs.
- HMM is a special case of **Dynamic Bayes Networks** (DBNs) in which the entire state of the world is represented by a single hidden state variable.
- HMM and **Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes** (POMDPs) have many similarities in their formulations. But in POMDPs, the user has some control (not just a spectator) over the process transitions between hidden states (introduction of the concept of `action`).
- Contrary to HMM, in **Naive Bayes model**, hidden state are fixed (no state sequence since there is no transition happening).
- States are hidden in HMM. They are fully observable in **Markov Chains**.
- HMM is a special case of **Generative Directed Graphs** (GDG), where the graphical structure is a first-order-chain structure (one could impose dependencies to arbitrary elements, not just on the previous element).
- **Linear-Chain CRF** can be seed as the discriminative version of HMM (like Logistic Regression and more generally  Maximum Entropy Models are the discriminate version of Naive Bayes) i.e. the consideration is on the conditional probability p(y|x) instead of the joint probability p(y,x).

- In **Conditional Random Fields** (CRF), the two strong (unreasonable) HMM hypotheses are dropped (it better addresses the so-called "labeling bias issue" but also become more complicated for inference).
- **Maximum Entropy Markov Models** combine features of HMMs (Markov chain connections) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models: it is a discriminative (not generative) model that allows the user to specify lots of correlated, but informative features.
	- MEMMs focus on pï¼ˆ`state|observation`), while HMMs focus on pï¼ˆ`observation|state`ï¼‰
	- btw, CRF can be seen as a more advanced MEMM with global variance normalization and with undirected connections, to address the issue of "label bias problem"
	- HMM models "state decides observation" and this is why it is called "generative". MEMMs model "observation decides state".

# Problem formulation

## Definitions:

A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a **5-tuple** composed of:

- A set of **Hidden States**: discrete random variable `lane` in {`Right Lane`, `Left Lane`}
- A set of possible **Observations**: discrete random variable `speed` in {`Low Speed`, `High Speed`}
- A stochastic matrix which gives **Emission probabilities**: `P[speed(t)` given `lane(t)]`
- A stochastic matrix which gives **Transition probabilities**: `P[lane(t+1)` given `lane(t)]`
- A **Initial State Probability** distribution: `P[lane(t=t0)]`

## Questions:
- [Q1](#q1) - How to **derive our probability models**?
- [Q2](#q2) - If you receive a **single `speed` observation**, what is the probability for the car to be in each lane?
- [Q3](#q3) - What is the probability to observe a particular **sequence of `speed` measurements**? For instance [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`].
- [Q32](#q32) - Given a **sequence of `speed` measurements**, what is the most likely **latest `lane`**?
- [Q4](#q4) - What is the **most likely `lane` sequence** if the **observation sequence** is [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`]?
- [Q5](#q5) - What if you are **not directly given the probability models**?

# Answers

## Q1 - How to derive our probability models?

Given some observation `speed` sequence and the associated `lane` states
- Here are only a few for simplicity but you could imagine longer recordings.
- You can think of it as some **samples** of the underlying **joint distributions**.
- How can we estimate the HMM parameters (for the emission, transition and intial state models)?
- We can count how many times each event occurs in the data and normalize the counts to form proper probability distributions.
- In can be formalize with **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** in the context of **Supervised Learning**.

The idea is to **approximate the model parameters by counting the occurrences**, similar to Naive Baye method where training is mainly done by counting features and classes.

### Transition probability

**Counting the number** of transitions, we can derive a **transition probability** model.
- For instance, among the `15` transitions starting from `right lane`, `3` ended in `left lane`.
	- Hence P[`right lane` -> `left lane`] = `0.2`
- Since probabilities must sum to one (normalization), or just by counting for the other case (`right lane` is followed `12` times by a `right lane`)
	- Hence P[`right lane` -> `right lane`] = `0.8`

|:--:| 
| *Derivation of the transition probability model* |

### Emission probability

Counting can also be used to determine the **emission probability** model.
- Similar to Naive Bayes in Supervised Learning where we count occurrences of features for all classes in the training data.
- For instance, how many times has the hidden state `left lane` caused a `high speed` observation?

| ![Derivation of the emission probability model](docs/deriving_emission_model.PNG "Derivation of the emission probability model")  | 
|:--:| 
| *Derivation of the emission probability model* |

## Initial state probability

At any time `t`, what is your guess on the **distribution of the hidden state if no observation is given**?
- Two options are available:
	- Either you use the transition model (1) and the fact that probabilities sum to `1` (2):
		- (1) P[`left lane`, `t`] = P[`left lane` -> `left lane`] `*` P[`left lane`, `t-1`] + P[`right lane` -> `left lane`] `*` P[`right lane`, `t-1`]
		- (2) P[`right lane`, `t`] = `1` - P[`left lane`, `t`]
	- Either you simply **count occurrences** in the supplied data. We simple count how many samples in the training data fall into each class (here state instance) divided by the total number of samples:
		- P[`left lane`, `t`] = `1/3`
		- P[`right lane`, `t`] = `2/3`

## Note: incomplete or missing state/observation

How to cope with **absence of one state or one observation instance in the sampled data**?

- Obviously we would need to collect much more pairs to refine the parameter estimation of our models.
- Clearly, assigning `0` may cause issues in the inference process.
- Every state could have a small emission probability of producing an unseen observation
	- P(`obs` | `state`) = `espilon_for_unseen_case` if `obs` has not been seen.
- Look for **"Laplace Smoothing"** or **"Additive Smoothing"** if you are interested.

## Q2 - If you receive a **single `speed` observation**, what is the probability for the car to be in each lane?

### Prior

Before any observation we know that `right lane` appears `2/3` of the time and `left lane` `1/3`.
- These probabilities would have been the answers if we were to **ignore the observation**.
- This distribution (called `prior`) must be **updated** when considering the observation.
- When considering the observation, the `prior` is converted to a `posterior` using `likelihood` terms.

### Likelihood

Based on supplied data, we found that on the left lane it is more likely to drive fast. And slow on the right lane.
In other words, you will be rather "suprised" if a left lane causes.
I like the concept of **"Surprise"** to introduce the concept of **"Likelihood"**
- The likelihood is, in this case, equivalent to the `emission probability`:
	- **given a state**, what is the probability for each observation.
- Actually, the question is interested by the exact opposite:
	- **given an observation**, what is the probability for each state?
	- this is called the `posterior` and is linked to `prior` via the `likelihood`.

### Marginal
The Bayes Rule states that `Posterior` = `Normalized (prior * likelihood)`
- The normalization (the posterior terms must sum to `1`) is achieved using the `Marginal Probabilities`.
- Under all possible hypotheses, how probable is each `speed`?
- Using the **law of total probability**:
	- P(`high speed`) = P(`high speed` given `left lane`) `*` P(`left lane`) + P(`high speed` given `right lane`) `*` P(`right lane`)
	- P(`low speed`) = P(`low speed` given `left lane`) `*` P(`left lane`) + P(`low speed` given `right lane`) `*` P(`right lane`)
- Eventually:
	- P(`high speed`) = `1/3`
	- P(`low speed`) = `2/3`

### Bayes Rule
- Let's use Bayesian Statistics to recap:
	- P(`lane` given `speed`) = P(`lane`) `*` P(`speed` given `lane`) / P(`speed`)
	- `Posterior` = `Prior` `*` `Likelihood` / `Marginal`
- For instance
	- P(`left lane` given `high speed`) = P(`left lane`) `*` P(`high speed` given `left lane`) / P(`high speed`)

Priors:
- P(`right lane`) = `2/3`
- P(`left lane`) = `1/3`

Marginals:
- P(`high speed`) = `1/3`
- P(`low speed`) = `2/3`

Likelihoods:
- P(`high speed` given `left lane`) = `0.6`
- P(`low speed` given `left lane`) = `0.4`
- P(`high speed` given `right lane`) = `0.2`
- P(`low speed` given `right lane`) = `0.8`

Posteriors:
- P(`left lane` given `high speed`) = `1/3` `*` `0.6` / `1/3` = `0.6`
- P(`left lane` given `low speed`) = `1/3` `*` `0.4` / `2/3` = `0.2`
- P(`right lane` given `high speed`) = `2/3` `*` `0.2` / `1/3` = `0.4`
- P(`right lane` given `low speed`) = `2/3` `*` `0.8` / `2/3` = `0.8`

### Summary

| ![Derivation of the posterior probabilities for a single observation](docs/posteriors.PNG "Derivation of the posterior probabilities for a single observation")  | 
|:--:| 
| *Derivation of the posterior probabilities for a single observation* |

The question was *given an observation, what is the most likely hidden state?*.
Well, just looking at the numbers on the figure below and taking the `max()`, the answer is:

- Given `high speed` is observed, the most likely state is `left lane`
- Given `low speed` is observed, the most likely state is `right lane`

It is close to our intuition.

This method is sometimes named **"Posterior Decoding"**.

## Q3 - What is the probability to observe a particular **sequence of `speed` measurements**?

Had it been a first-order Markov Chain (no hidden state), one could have marginalized over all `speed(t)` observations and simplify the large expression using the **conditional independance** offered by the Markov Property.

The final expression would be:
- P([`speed(1)`, ..., `speed(t)`]) = P[`speed(1)`] * SUM ( P([`speed(t)` given `speed(t-1)`]) )

In the HMM case, we need to add some modifications:
- We use the **transition model** to navigate between two states.
- We use the **emission model** to generate each observation.

| ![Derivation of the marginal probability of an observation sequence](docs/marginal_proba_obs_sequence.PNG "Derivation of the probability of an observation sequence")  | 
|:--:| 
| *Derivation of the probability of an observation sequence* |

This requires to develop all the possible state sequences of size T.
- In our case state space has size `2` (`left_lane`, `right_lane`). Hence the **sum will contain `2^T` terms**.
- This **naive** (meaning we list all the possibilities based on the **definition of marginal probabilities**) approach can nevertheless **become impractible** for larger state spaces and/or large sequence sizes.

An alternative is to use Dynamic Programming.
- the idea is to compute cells in a table `alpha`(`i`, `t`)
	- think of rows (index `i`) as state instances (`left_lane`, `right_lane`)
	- think of columns (index `t`) as time step (`t`=`1`, `t`=`2`, ... , `t`=`T`)
- three notable relations:
	- 1st relation: **`alpha`(`i`, `t+1`) can be computed from `alpha`(`i`, `t`)**.
		- Hence we can the table can be filled efficiently (only `2T` terms in the table)
		- Idea of the derivation:
			- marginalize `alpha`(`i`, `t+1`) over `state(t)`
			- split `observation[1 ... t+1]` = `observation[1 ... t]` + `observation(t+1)`
			- decompose the joint probability into a product of conditional probabilities (isolate `observation(t+1)` and `state(t+1)`)
			- use **conditional independance** to simplify two terms ([given `state(t)`, `state(t+1)` is independant of all possible `observation`] and [given `state(t+1)`, `observation(t+1)` is independant of all other terms])
			- three terms are left:  [emission at `t+1`], [transition from `t` to `t+1`] and [`alpha`(`i`, `t`)]
			- `alpha`(`i`, `t+1`) = [emission at `t+1`] * SUM[over `state(t)`] [transition`t`to`t+1` * `alpha`(`i`, `t`)]
	- 2nd relation: the table initialisation [`alpha`(`i`, `t=1`)] is easily computed with the initial state distribution and the emission model.
	- 3rd relation: the marginal probability (what we are really looking for) can be expressed with the `alpha`(`i`, `T`) (just by **summing the terms of the last column**).
	- Therefore it is **computationally-efficient** to fill the `alpha` table to **derive the marginal distribution of observation sequence**.

| ![Derivation of the `alpha table`](docs/alpha_derivation.PNG "Derivation of the `alpha table`")  | 
|:--:| 
| *Derivation of the `alpha table`* |

Each element in the column `t+1` is a weighted sum of the elements at `t`:
- The weights are the transition probabilities
- The obtained sum is finally scaled by the emission probability (for the state `i` to emit the observation present at `t+1` in our observation sequence)

|:--:| 
| *Construction of the `alpha table` Dynamic Programming* |

Once the `alpha table` is constructed, it is straight forward to get the the **marginal probability** for the associated **observation sequence**:
- summing the `alpha` values at time `t` gives the probabily of the observation sequence up to time `t`
- for instance, among the `8` possible 3-observable sequence, [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`] has a probability = `0.13184`

## Q32 - Given a **sequence of `speed` measurements**, what is the most likely **latest `lane`**?

Filtering is one important application for robotics and **autonomous driving**:
- We often want to **estimate the current state** of some objects (e.g. _position_, _speed_, or a belief over the _route intention_).
- In order to **reduce the variance of the estimate**, you may want not to base your estimation only on the latest measurement.
- Hence, similar to what is done with Bayesian Filters (BFs) (such as **Kalman Filters**, **Particles Filters**), two ingredients are used to update your latest **State Belief**:
	- a **sequence of measurements** (= **observation**)
	- some evolution **models**
		- for instance odometry measurements and `constant acceleration` or `constant velocity` models in the context of **sensor fusion** for localization
		- here we have an emission model and a transition model)

The form of the `alpha table` turns out to be very appropriate for **filtering**:
- Let's focus on P(`lane(t=3)` == `right` given [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`])
- Express condition probability with the joint probability.
- Note that we find the **marginal probability of the observation sequence** at the denominator.
- Marginalize it over last the hidden state `lane(t=3)`.
- All terms left are `alpha` values.

|:--:| 
| *Use of the `alpha table` for **filtering**** |


#### Note: Markov Property

> Why do you consider **all the three observations**? Does not the **Markov Property** state that you **only need the latest one**?

Have a look at the graphical representation of the HMM.
- The Markov Property only applies for the transitions between hidden states.
- The rule of **D-separation** (commonly used in **Bayesian Networks**) states that the knowledge of the realisation of one previous hidden could have blocked the path from some observations.
- That would have made our result **conditionally independant** of these observations.
- For instance, in P(`lane(t=3)` == `right` given [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`] and `lane(t=1)`==`right`), the first observation (at `t=1`) is useless since all its paths to `lane(t=3)` (there is only one path here) are blocked by `lane(t=1)` (which realisation is known).
- Since we only consider realisations of observation, no simplification can be done.

Actually, when filtering over the last observation only, we get a different result:
- P(`lane(t=3)` == `right` given [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`]) = 0.73786
- P(`lane(t=1)` == `right` given [`low speed`]) = 0.8 (also readable in the `alpha table`: `8/10` `/` (`8/10` + `2/10`) )

#### From `alpha table` to `beta table`

The `alpha table` can be used:
- To determine the belief state (**filtering**).
- To compute **marginal probability** of an **observation sequence**.

Note that the `alpha table` was completed starting **from left and moving to right**
- This is the reason why this inference method is called **"Forward Algorithm"**
- One could have the idea of going the other way round.
- This would lead to the **`beta table`**

The `beta table` can actually be used to compute the **marginal probability of an observation sequence**:
- Let's focus on P([`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`])
- Marginalize over the first hidden state `lane(t=1)` (insert it in the joint distribution and sum over all its possible realisations)
- Write the decomposition specific to the HMM structure (an **first-order Markov Chain**).
- The term P(`speed[2 ... t]` given `lane(1)`==`j`) is by definition `beta`(`j`, `t=1`)
- In other words, the **marginal probability of an observation sequence** can be obtained by summing the terms in the **first columns** of the associated `beta table`.

## Q4 - What is the **most likely `lane` sequence** if the **observation sequence** is [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`]?

### Question interpretation

When trying to **reformulate the question**, I was puzzled since I ended up with two possible answers.

It all depends on what we mean with _"What is the **most likely state sequence** given an observation sequence?"_

- it can be the state sequence that has the **highest conditional probability?** This is was we have done in [Q2](#q2) with `#BayesRule`. `#PosteriorDecoding`.
- it can be the state sequence that **makes the observation sequence the most likely to happen?** `#MLE`. `#Viterbi`. In this case, we compute the **Joint Probabilities** i.e. the probabilities for the **Intersection** [`State Sequence` `+` `Observation Sequence`].
- ??(can the MLE be on the conditional probability of observation given state? what differs with the upper joint event is the normalization)??

In other words, the answer could be maximizing two kind of probability

- either the **conditional probability**: (state **given** observation)
- or the **joint probability**: (state **and** observation).

> For this question, we will be looking for the **most likely sequence of hidden states** which could have generated a **given observation sequence**.

#### Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
We will to **pick the sequence (in [Q5](#q5) it was of size `1`) of hidden states that makes the observations the most likely to happen**.

This method is called **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** (MLE).

Here are the different steps performed for the observation sequence [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`].
- First enumerate the `2^3 = 8` possible sequences of hidden states.
- For each candidate, **compute the probability for the state sequence candidate to generate the observation sequence**.
	- Start by the probability of the first state element to happen (**initial state probability**).
	- List the **emission** and **transition probabilities**.
	- The probability of the observation sequence (?likelihood) is the product of all listed probabilities (thank @MarkovProperty).
- Apply `max()` to get the **Maximum Likelihood Estimate**:
	- In this case, the state sequence [`right lane`, `right lane`, `right lane`] makes the observation sequence the most likely to happen.

For instance with the state sequence candidate [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`]
- The **joint probability** is the product of all the probabilities listed on the figure below.
- P([`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`] `&&` [`right lane`, `left lane`, `right lane`]) = `0.02048`

#### Note

`0.1318394` `=` `0.01152` `+` `0.01536` `+` `0.000853` `+` `0.01536` `+` `0.054613` `+` `0.0068267` `+` `0.02048` `+` `0.0068267`

If you sum all the probabilities of the eight cases depicted the figure above, you do not end up to `1`, but to `0.1318394`. Why?
- Well, `0.1318394` represents the **probability for the observation sequence** [`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`] to happen.
	- P[`low speed`, `high speed`, `low speed`] = P[`obs`] = P[`obs` `&&` `state seq1`] + P[`obs` `&&` `state seq2`] + ... + P[`obs` `&&` `state seq8`]
	- ?? total probability is with conditional. What is it with intersections?
	- We had already find this result in [Q3](#q3)
- What would sum to `1` is the sum over all possible 3-element observation sequences:
	- `1` = P[`LLL`] + P[`LLH`] + P[`LHL`] + P[`LHH`] + P[`HLL`] + P[`HLH`] + P[`HHL`] + P[`HHH`]

The presented approach could be used for **larger observation sequences**.
By the way you notice that HMM can **handle inputs of variable length**.
But for longer observation sequences, an issue appears:

| Size of the `observation` sequence | Number of probabilities to compute before applying `max()` (for **MLE**) |
| :---:        |     :---:      |
| `1`   | `2`     |
| `2`   | `4`     |
| `3`   | `8`     |
| `i`     | `2^i`       |
| `10`     | `1024`       |

### Dynamic Programming

Assume that after the second observation, the sub-sequence (`left lane`, `right lane`) is found to be more likely that the sub-sequence (`right lane`, `right lane`).
- Is it **worth carry on some investigation** in the branch (`left lane`, `right lane`)?
- Do not forget that the only goal is to **find the most likely sequence (and nothing else)!**
- Whatever you append to the sub-sequence (`left lane`, `right lane`), the resulting sequence will be less likely than appending the same to (`right lane`, `right lane`).

This example show the intuition of `Dynamic Programming`:

> Compute local blocks and consider only the most promising ones to build the next ones.

Viterbi algorithm
- first think the HMM in the **trellis representation**
- then understand that we are interested in finding the best path from the start to the end (**Viterby path**)
	- "best" meaning the one that maximizes the cumulative probability
- to achieve that, we should first compute each trellis score (based on our trained emission and transition probability models)

Viterbi algorithm uses the Markov assumption to relax the computation of score of a best path up to position i ending in state t.

## Q5 - What if you are **not directly given the probability models**?
	

### Note: Generative VS Discriminative Models
The approaches used in supervised learning can be categorized into discriminative models or generative models.

Our final goal is to infer a sequence of states (let's refer to this random variable as `Y`) given observation (call it `X`).
Before this **inference phase** (we just saw how to do it in [Q4](#q4)), we need:
- 1- to assume some models. We will assume some functional form for P(Y), P(X|Y)
- 2- to find their parameters (**Training Phase**) as we receive some data (this is **Supervised Learning**)

More precisely, during training:
- 1- we assume that the observed data are truly sampled from the generative model,
- 2- then we fit the parameters of the generative model to maximize the data likelihood.

In prediction (inference), given an observation, it computes the predictions for all classes and returns the class most likely to have generated the observation.
- Similar to Naive Bayes classifier, HMM tries to predict which class generated the new observed example.

Why are HMMs Generative Models?

It is possible to **generate** a sequence of observation from the HMM model (= **Sampling**)
- 1- first, sample an initial state
- 2- then, for t=2 until t=T, sample two quantities:
	- sample a new state (based on the transition model)
	- sample an observation for this state (based on the emission model)
- Another option it to first generate a state sequence (based on the transition model). Then sample for each state sample its observation (using the emission model)

- 1- During training, the goal is to estimate parameters of **P(`X|Y`)**, **P(`Y`)**
	- Our model explicitly describes the prior distribution on states, not just the conditional distribution of the observation given the current state
	- It actually gives a joint distribution on states and outputs
	- Indeed before seeing any observation, we already have an idea on the `Y` distribution (`P(Y)` is our `initial state probability`)
	- Discriminative Models do not have any prior. They contemplate the different instances of `Y` and make decision based on P(`Y|X`) they have learnt.
	- CRFs are discriminative models which model P(y|x). As such, they do not require to explicitly model P(x)
During inference, we listed all possible instance of Y and select the one that maximizes the **joint probability distribution p(x,y)**.

- 2 - during inference we compute **joint distributions** before making a decision
	- Generative classifiers are interested in the joint distribution (think of **NaÃ¯ve Bayes**, **Bayesian networks**,  **Gaussian Mixture Model**, **Markov random fields**)
		- returns the class that as the maximum posterior probability given the features
	- While Discriminative classifiers consider either a **conditional distribution** (think of **â€ŒLogistic regression**) or no distribution (think of **SVM**, **perceptron**).

- 3 - Terminology
	- a [generative model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model) can be used to **"generate"** random instances (outcomes):
		- either of an observation and target (`x`, `y`)
		- or of an observation `x` given a target value `y`,
		- One of the advantages of generative algorithms is that you can use p(x,y) to generate new data similar to existing data.
		- it asks the question: based on my generation assumptions, which category is most likely to generate this signal?
		- takes the joint probability P(x,y), where x is the input and y is the label, and predicts the most possible known label y in Y for the unknown variable x using Bayes Rules.
	
	- while a [discriminative model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discriminative_model) or discriminative classifier (without a model) can be used to **"discriminate"** the value of the target variable `Y`, **given an observation `x`**
		- I give you features `x`, you tell me the most likely class `y`.
		- A discriminative algorithm does not care about how the data was generated, it simply categorizes a given signal.
		- They do not need to model the distribution of the observed variables
		- They make fewer assumptions on the distributions but depend heavily on the quality of the data.
		- They direct map the given unobserved variable (target) x a class label y depended on the observed variables (training samples)	
		- They try to learn which features from the training examples are most useful to discriminate between the different possible classes.
	
We are trying to find the parameters for multiple probabilities:
- **Initial state probability**: `P[lane(t)]`. It can be seen as the prior.

- **Emission probability**: `P[speed(t)` given `lane(t)]`
- **Transition probability**: `P[lane(t+1)` given `lane(t)]`

Generative Learning Algorithms:
- without any observation, we already know the distribution.

[Here](https://medium.com/@mlengineer/generative-and-discriminative-models-af5637a66a3) is a nice post to get an intuition of Generative an Discriminative models.

- at a crossing, make prediction of the route of other vehicles
	- `route` in {`left`, `straight`, `right`} is the hidden variable

# Draft
Viterbi finds the best state assignment to the sequence State1 ... StateN as a whole
Posterior Decoding consists in picking the highest state posterior for each position ii in the sequence independently.

Both HMMs and linear CRFs are typically trained with Maximum Likelihood techniques such as gradient descent, Quasi-Newton methods or for HMMs with Expectation Maximization techniques (Baum-Welch algorithm).
If the optimization problems are convex, these methods all yield the optimal parameter set.

Label bias problem
- Only for MEMM.
- An observation can affect which destination states get the mass, but not how much total mass to pass on
- This causes a bias toward states with fewer outgoing transitions
- In the extreme case, a state with a single outgoing transition effectively ignores the observation.
- Sol: CRFs are globally re-normalized

most likely path through the HMM or MEMM would be defined as the one that is most likely to generate the observed sequence of tokens. 

The basic idea is, first, to establish the probability density model of the sample, and then use the model for inference prediction
The method draws from statistical mechanics and Bayes theory.
HMM directly models the transition probability and phenotype probability, and calculates the probability of co-occurrence. Thus, it is a generative model.

HMM directly models the transition probability and the phenotype probability, and calculates the probability of co-occurrence.
It is Bayes Rule that forms the basis of HMM. On the contrary, CRF and MEMMâ€™s based on MaxEnt models over transition and observable features.
